          <p>
            We are an energetic young tutoring company made up entirely of current Oxford students with a love for education. We teach the full range of sixth form, secondary school and primary school subjects, as well as university admissions and scholarship preparation. 
        Our mission is to deliver insightful, engaging, and effective tutoring in every subject and level we teach.

          <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Subjects We Teach</h2>
          <p>
            From GCSE Maths to A-Level English Literature, we provide in-depth support across the full academic spectrum â€” tailored to each student. Between us, we have extensive experience teaching almost every subject at every level. Whether it's helping young students learn to read, catching up year 8s who've fallen behind in maths, or helping those who are aiming for an A* in Further Mathematics get ready for their exams, we can do it. We take a lot of care in matching students with the right tutor - someone who they connect with and over time build a strong professional bond with - and so whatever you're looking for, send us a message!

          <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">University Admissions</h2>
          <p>
            We specialise in Oxbridge applications, personal statement guidance, entrance exams and interview coaching. As we are all current Oxford students who went through the application process only a few years ago, we are well aware of what it entails. We know what kind of preparation is useful, and what isn't. In the medium-term, we can assess a student's strengths and weaknesses through one-on-one sesssions with our Senior Tutors and give them advice on what areas to focus on and what the most effective ways of doing so are. As part of this medium-term preparation, we can give students reading lists, marked writing assignments, preparation lessons for course-specific exams like the TSA and PAT (some of which are also used by other top universities, including the London School of Economics). We also give advice on how to most efficiently manage their A-level work whilst simultaneously preparing for university entrance exams. When it comes to short-term preparation, we do mock interviews and confidence building sessions to help students perform at their best.

          <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Scholarship Preparation</h2>
          <p>
            We help students prepare for competitive scholarship applications and entrance examinations. Our past students include some who have won King's Scholarships to Eton college, and many more who successfully sat the entrance exams to other top public schools like Winchester, Harrow, and St Paul's. We have also successfully prepared students who went on to win scholarhsips to excellent Australian private schools like Haileybury College and Wesley College.
