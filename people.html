            Hi! I'm a PPE student at Balliol College, Oxford. I graduated high school only a few years ago, so don't worry, I can definitely remember the stress of tests, homework and A-levels. I think one of the most important things a tutor can do is increase a student's confidence, so I'm not going to come across as intimidating or add to the pressure you already face at school. I'll still be challenging you, though!
I have 3 years' experience tutoring high school level philosophy, politics, maths, English, history, and economics, with both students who have special needs and those who excel at their schoolwork. I teach all the way from primary school to sixth form, and occasionally tutor university students as well.
