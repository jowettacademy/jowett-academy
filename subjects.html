    <div class="space-y-10">
      
      <div>
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-blue-800 mb-2">University Admissions</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-700">
         We provide tailored support for students applying to universities, including guidance on choosing the right course, help with personal statements, and interview preparation. We also help students prepare for Oxbridge admissions tests, inlcuding the TSA, TMUA, PAT, MLAT, BMSAT and UCAT. 
        </p>

      <div>
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-blue-800 mb-2">A Levels</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-700">
          Between us, we teach Maths, Further Maths, Chemistry, Physics, Biology, Economics, Politics, Philosophy, English, History, French, Italian, Latin and Greek. Not only do our tutors study these subjects at university, they all received top marks in their A Levels in these subjects and so know exactly what the examiners are looking for.
      </div>

      <div>
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-blue-800 mb-2">VCE</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-700">
          For students undertaking the Victorian Certificate of Education (VCE), we teach English, Further Maths, Mathematical Methods, Specialist Maths, Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Economics, Politics, Philosophy, French, Italian, Latin and Greek. While not all of us went to school in Victoria (although some did), for maths and sciences the VCE curriculum is very similar to the A level curriculum and our British tutors have no trouble teaching the Australian versions of their subjects. For essay-based subjects, rest assured you'll be taught by someone who's gone through the ins and outs of VCE and knows what kinds of essay structures are most effective at getting you top marks.

      <div>
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-blue-800 mb-2">GCSE</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-700">
          We teach pretty much the full range of GCSE subjects. In addition to everything we teach at A level, we also teach GCSE Business Studies, Geography, Psychology, Music, and Electronics, just to name a few. If you're doing a less common GCSE, send us a message and we'll let you know if we teach your subject or not!
        </p>

      <div>
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-blue-800 mb-2">Scholarship Preparation</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-700">
         We have extensive experience preparing students of varyign ages for scholarship exams and other school entrance tests. Some of our past students have won King's Scholarships to Eton College, others have been awarded scholarships to top Australian independent schools like Haileybury College and Wesley College, and many more have receieved a place in other top English public schools like Harrow and Westminster. 
        </p>

      <div>
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-blue-800 mb-2">Lower Years</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-700">
          For younger students, we can and do teach all school subjects, and have a lot of experience helping students who are struggling with their schoolwork to develop the confidence and background academic ability required for them to catch up to their classmates. Equally, however, often the reason younger students want tutoring is that they aren't being challenged in school. We love providing tailored programs to extend capable students beyond what they would learn at school, in whichever academic direction they are interested in exploring. Please contact us to have a chat about what we might be able to do for your child!
